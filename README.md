## **Features**
- A set of **SQL challenges** with **detailed queries** and explanations.
- Covers essential topics like:
  - SELECT queries with filtering & sorting
  - Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
  - JOIN operations (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
  - Subqueries & Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
  - Window functions & ranking
- Easy-to-follow structure for learning and practice.

## **Dataset**
The project uses a sample database containing columns such as:
- **Employees** (Employee details, department, salary, etc.)
- **Orders** (Customer transactions, products, order status, etc.)
- **Products** (Product catalog with pricing and category information)

The dataset can be modified or replaced with real-world data as needed.

```

### **Question 2: Find total sales per product category**
#### **Solution:**
```sql
SELECT p.category, SUM(o.total_price) AS total_sales
FROM Orders o
JOIN Products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.category;
```
